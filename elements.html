									<p><font color=black>RADAR research has been ongoing for the past 70 years and a significant portion of the past research has concerned the use of CFAR based algorithms. However, there are still many possibilities for researching new algorithm combinations, as with rapid developments in technology, we are able to execute algorithms that were only discussed in theory in the past. </font></p>

									<h3>How does Radar work?</h3>
									<p>Radar systems transmit electromagnetic waveforms to detect the movement and position of targets. Most targets reflect the radio waves which can be detected and processed by the radar system to determine the distance to and velocity of the target. However, the received signal can also consist of unwanted signals like noise and clutter, complicating the process of accurately identifying the target.</p>

			<h3>Project Basis - Constant False Alarm Rate</h3>
			<p>The Constant False Alarm Rate family of algorithms are commonly used in radar detection systems to detect targets in the presence of background noise and clutter while maintaining a fixed false alarm rate using an adaptive detection threshold. False alarm rate is how often a system falsely detects a target, and a detection threshold is a specified amplitude value that marks the boundary between targets and noise. Returning amplitudes of the received signal greater than the detection threshold for a given false alarm rate are usually considered targets, while the amplitudes less than it are considered noise.</p>

			<h3>Putting CFAR into a broader context</h3>
			<p>CFAR algorithms play a central role in the general process of radar detection. First, the radar sends out a pulse signal, and noise data is returned. This pulse is sent in every single direction, or a 360 degree rotation. Then, for each sample of noise data returned, a CFAR algorithm is applied to establish a threshold and find detections. Then, the detections over all the different directions are then clustered to show entire targets on the tracker.</p>

			<h3>Identify Detection Threshold - Noise Mean Estimate</h3>
			<p>Current research has significantly improved radar detection techniques, but it is important to invest in prototyping and testing the performance of new ideas. One potential area for further investigation regarding current detection systems is with the methods used to establish the noise mean estimate, the average noise amplitude surrounding a potential target which is used to set detection threshold.</p>

			<h3>Current CFAR Algorithms</h3>
			<p>Over the years, various CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) based algorithms such as GO-CFAR (Greatest Of CFAR), SO-CFAR (Smallest Of CFAR) and CA-CFAR (Cell Averaging CFAR) were developed to adaptively establish the noise mean estimate and set the radar detection threshold in the presence of unwanted signals for a specified false alarm rate. These algorithms are based on logic such as using the mean or median or a subset of the noise points to determine the detection threshold and were designed to address individual problems such as detecting targets in a specific environment. There is significant potential for improvement with the methods used in these algorithms to establish the noise mean estimate.</p>
