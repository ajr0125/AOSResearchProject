		<h3>Progress Update #4 (September 7th - Present): Global Research Collaboration Program </h3>
		<p>My research project was selected for participation in the AOS Global Research Collaboration Program with the South Korean students of Daegu Science High School. We introduced our projects to each other and collaborated to develop a combined research proposal that we presented to the Academy of Science and Daegu Science High School faculty on October 25, 2021. Now, we plan to continue moving forward with our collaboration by neeting every two to three weeks on zoom to ahare progress status and updates. </p>

		<h3>Progress Update #3 (August 26th - Present): Project Presentations</h3>
		<p>At the beginning of my junior year, I was able to present my radar research project to my peers and answer any questions they had, which helped me identify potential areas of improvement in my project to fix and improve my presentation skills. I also began developing basic CFAR algorithms in MatLab that I would eventually use for performance comparison against my prototype. These algorithms include the CA-CFAR, GO-CFAR, SO-CFAR and more. I also developed methods to generate the signal and noise data that I would use to evaluate the performance of these algorithms. </p>

		<h3>Progress Update #2 (May 8th, 2021 - August 26th, 2021): Summer Coursework </h3>
		<p>Over the summer, I continued to develop my background in the areas of machine learning and CFAR. I finished the final section of the Mathematics in Machine Learning Course and also began the Udemy Machine Learning A-Z course to learn more specifically about the entire machine learning process, including data preprocessing and different algorithms that can be used to train a model on data. Finally, I started learning the basics of MatLab, which I would eventually use to code my CFAR algorithms, by working through the built-in tutorials on MatLab Online.</p>

		<h3>Progress Update #1 (January 27th, 2021 - May 8th, 2021): Initial Development of Project</h3>
		<p>At the start of this year, I began the early stages of creating my project, which included meeting with expert scientists in the field, writing a background paper, creating proposal videos, and working on machine learning courses to gain a better background in the radar field. Specifically, I enrolled in the online Beaverworks Institute course at MIT, which focused on data science concepts and introduced machine learning. I also began the Couresa Mathematics in Machine Learning course. This work culminated in signatures of approval from research mentors, which allowed me to move forward with my project. </p>
