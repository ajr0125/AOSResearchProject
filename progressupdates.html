		<h3>Progress Update #7 (November 1st, 2021): FOD-CFAR and OSVI-CFAR Initial Development</h3>
		<p>While continuing to develop other algorithms for eventual performance comparison, I started to research in much more detail my project's primary algorithms: the FOD-CFAR and the OSVI-CFAR. After researching, I started taking initial steps towards developing these algorithms by starting with threshold computations, as well as outlining the inner workings of the algorithms conceptually with pseudocode.</p>

		<h3>Progress Update #6 (October 1st, 2021): Developing Algorithms for Performance Comparison</h3>
		<p>Using the knowledge I gained from the previous month, I started to develop the different CFAR algorithms that I researched in MatLab, specifically the CA-CFAR, GO-CFAR, SO-CFAR, and CMLD-CFAR. Since the papers only described the algorithms conceptually, I had to use the threshold formulas provided to develop the algorithms from scratch. Then, I would attempt to replicate the results of the paper for confirmation that I programmed the algorithm correctly. The development of these algorithms lasted for the rest of October.</p>

		<h3>Progress Update #5 (September 7th, 2021): Global Research Collaboration Program </h3>
		<p>My research project was selected for participation in the AOS Global Research Collaboration Program with the South Korean students of Daegu Science High School. We introduced our projects to each other and collaborated to develop a combined research proposal that we presented to the Academy of Science and Daegu Science High School faculty on October 25, 2021. Now, we plan to continue moving forward with our collaboration by meeting every two to three weeks on zoom to share progress status and updates. </p>

		<h3>Progress Update #4 (September 1st, 2021): Project Background</h3>
		<p>In order to gain more background for my project, I continued to research different CFAR algorithms I could develop for performance comparison against my prototype. For instance, I started with the CA-CFAR in the research paper "A Study Of CFAR Implementation Cost And Performance Tradeoffs In Heterogeneous Environments" and moved on to the GO-CFAR and SO-CFAR using the paper "Performance Analysis of Various Constant False Alarm Receivers in non-homogeneous background for Multi-Mission Radar". This background research lasted for the rest of September.</p>

		<h3>Progress Update #3 (August 26th, 2021): Project Presentations</h3>
		<p>At the beginning of my junior year, I was able to present my radar research project to my peers and answer any questions they had, which helped me identify potential areas of improvement in my project to fix and improve my presentation skills. I also began researching basic CFAR algorithms in MatLab that I would eventually use for performance comparison against my prototype. These algorithms include the CA-CFAR, GO-CFAR, SO-CFAR and more. I also developed methods to generate the signal and noise data that I would use to evaluate the performance of these algorithms. These presentations continued for the first quarter of the school year, specifically until November 3rd, 2021.</p>

		<h3>Progress Update #2 (May 8th, 2021): Summer Coursework </h3>
		<p>Over the summer, I continued to develop my background in the areas of machine learning and CFAR. I finished the final section of the Mathematics in Machine Learning Course and also began the Udemy Machine Learning A-Z course to learn more specifically about the entire machine learning process, including data preprocessing and different algorithms that can be used to train a model on data. Finally, I started learning the basics of MatLab, which I would eventually use to code my CFAR algorithms, by working through the built-in tutorials on MatLab Online. This coursework lasted the entire summer and ended once the 2021-2022 school year began.</p>

		<h3>Progress Update #1 (January 27th, 2021): Initial Development of Project</h3>
		<p>At the start of this year, I began the early stages of creating my project, which included meeting with expert scientists in the field, writing a background paper, creating proposal videos, and working on machine learning courses to gain a better background in the radar field. Specifically, I enrolled in the online Beaverworks Institute course at MIT, which focused on data science concepts and introduced machine learning. I also began the Coursera Mathematics in Machine Learning course. This work culminated in signatures of approval from research mentors, which allowed me to move forward with my project. This phase of the project continued until the start of summer.</p>
